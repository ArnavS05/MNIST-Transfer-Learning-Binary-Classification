# MNIST-Transfer-Learning-Binary-Classification
The purpose of this activity is to use Transfer Learning and realise that how the model forgets the old data and gets accustomed to the new data. Here, initially, two binary classification models, A & B, will be trained. A will be trained on the data set having only 1s and 7s while B will be trained on the data set having only 3s and 8s. Then, model A will be used for transfer learning on data set having 3s and 8s whereas model B will be used for transfer learning on data set having 1s and 7s. The new models will be called model AB and BA respectively.
